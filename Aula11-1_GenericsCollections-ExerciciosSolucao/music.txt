I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemys eyes
Listened as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead
Long live the king

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs is singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I cannot explain
Once you would gone there was never
Never an honest word
That was when I ruled the world
